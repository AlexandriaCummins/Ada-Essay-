#### 1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far? 
Programming is interesting to me for a ton of reasons. It is a learner's paradise of information where every day and with every different project you are exposed to something new and constantly evolving your skill. Programming is the science behind web pages, applications and software that we use daily, and the more I learn about it, the more immersed I become. One of the best feelings for me, is changing what seems to be minute details in the code and watching my creation come to life. It is so satisfying! Another reason would be that programming is an industry that is never going out of style. It is the backbone of tech and could launch me into a bright new career with endless possibilities to do something life changing and expansive. I have always been intrigued by web-design and development, and have a few friends who are application developers or techies, mostly men. Diveristy is yet another great reason, being a woman in the tech industry would be greatly satisfying and empowering for myself and women around me. Since programming is such an important part of the tech world and in turn, the real one; it is important that women not sit back and let this be a male dominated feild. 

I have recenlty exposed myself to programming by using Code Academy, where I have completed 3 different lessons and will continue to teach myself. Other than that I have been creating my own peronal webpage/blog that will be about one of my other passions: cooking.
