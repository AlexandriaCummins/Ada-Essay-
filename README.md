#### 1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far? 
Programming is a learner's paradise of information. Every day and every project exposes you to something new, constantly evolving your skill. One of the best feelings for me is changing what seems to be minute details in the code and watching my creation come to life. It is so satisfying! I have recently exposed myself to programming through Codecademy, where I have completed various intensive and creative lessons, and will continue to teach myself. I have always been intrigued by web design and development, and have a few friends, mostly male, who are application developers or techies. Being a woman in the tech industry is truly empowering for myself and the women around me. Since programming is such an important part of the tech world, and in turn, the real world, it is important that women not sit back and remain underrepresented in the field.  Programming is an industry that is never going out of style;  it is the backbone of technology, and I am looking forward to a bright new career with endless possibilities to do something life changing and expansive.   

  

#### 2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years? 
After completion of the program, I will have the skills necessary to be a successful web developer, with a complete understanding of core languages, web concepts, and design sense. I would be working for a company/organization with strong core values, surrounded by a team of unique individuals where we would have strong communication, mutual respect, and complementary skill sets. I would love to get a job developing websites/applications for non-profit organizations, where I could use my knowledge of programming to make a difference in local communities.  


#### 3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?  
My contribution to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community is simple: I just have to be myself. As a woman of 27 years I have experienced more than my fair share of sexism, and all those other terrible isms that people use to judge or "class" one another. I am a person who is all-inclusive and open to learning others' perspectives and yearn for an open community. The opportunity to be learning programming among a group of diverse, bright women is exciting and empowering to me.   
   




#### 4.Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently? 
One of the biggest mistakes I've made was being in college and not trying my best. I was stubborn and young, and I snapped between majors like a camera shutter. I studied photography and early childhood education, trying my not-so-best to find direction. After the first year of complete misdirection on my part, I had a revelation. I learned that if I would have entered into my education with a strong focus, I would have had a much more fulfilling and successful experience. 

If I could go back and do it differently, I would have spent much more time considering what path I wanted to choose. In essence, that is what this program symbolizes for me. With a vision in mind, I would put 100% of my effort into what I was doing and would be mindful of the fact that my actions directly correlated to my future, career, life path, and financial status. At this point in my life, I am so excited to feel passionate about a field that is ever-evolving, challenging, and rewarding.
