#### 1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far? 
Programming is interesting to me for a ton of reasons. It is a learner's paradise of information. Every day and with every different project you are exposed to something new and constantly evolving your skill. Programming is the science behind web pages, applications, and software that we use daily, and the more I learn about it, the more immersed I become. One of the best feelings for me is changing what seems to be minute details in the code and watching my creation come to life. It is so satisfying! Another reason would be that programming is an industry that is never going out of style. It is the backbone of tech and could launch me into a bright new career with endless possibilities to do something life changing and expansive. I have always been intrigued by web design and development, and have a few friends who are application developers or techies, mostly men. Diversity is yet another great reason; being a woman in the tech industry would be greatly satisfying and empowering for myself and women around me. Since programming is such an important part of the tech world, and in turn, the real world, it is important that women not sit back and let this be a male dominated feild. 

I have recently exposed myself to programming through Codecademy, where I have completed many different lessons and will continue to teach myself. Other than that I have been creating my own peronal webpage/blog that will be about one of my other passions: cooking. 

  

#### 2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years? 
If accepted into Ada I see myself going to amazing places on my career path. After completion of the program I will have the skills neccessary to be a successful web developer, with a complete understanding of core languages, web concepts, and design sense. I imagine that I would either be working for a private company or for the government. I would be working for a company/organization with strong core values, surrounded by a team of unique individuals where we would have stong communication, mutual respect, and completementary skill sets. I would love to get a job developing websites/applications for non-profit organizations, where I could use my knowledge of programming to make a difference in our local communites. 


#### 3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?  
My contribution to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community is simple: I just have to be myself. Although I am not a minority, I am not gender fluid or trans, I feel I am still an asset to a diverse community.  As a woman of 27 years I have experienced more than my fair share of sexism, and all those other terrible isms that people use to judge or "class" one another. I am a person who is all inclusive and open to learning about others' perspectives and yearn for an open community. The opportunity to be learning programming among a group of diverse, bright women is exciting and empowering to me.  
   




#### 4.Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently? 
A mistake I made and learned a lot from, here we go: 

When I was a freshman in college I begged my parents to let me take a year off of school to recharge my batteries and hang out with my friends. My parents were not having it and they stood strong on the basis that if they were paying for my school, I was to go in the fall. So I went, dragging my feet, and I started my first semester of college at Daytona State. My biggest mistake was being in college and not trying my best. I was stubborn and young, and I snapped between majors like a camera shutter. I studied photography and early childhood education, trying my not so best to find direction. I skipped class so often I had to repeat one of them. My parents were not pleased.

After the first year of complete misdirection and stubbornness on my part, I had a revelation. If I would have just put my whole effort into what I was doing at the time, I would have been done much sooner and with less pain. I learned that if I would have gone to class, focused, and stayed positive I would have had a much better experience that first year. If I could go back and do it differently, I would have spent much more time studying and focusing on what major I wanted to choose. I would have put 100% effort into what I was doing and realized that my actions then directly correlated to my future career, life path, and financial status.
