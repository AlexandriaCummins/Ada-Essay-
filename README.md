#### 1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far? 
Programming is interesting to me for a ton of reasons. It is a learner's paradise of information where every day and with every different project you are exposed to something new and constantly evolving your skill. Programming is the science behind web pages, applications and software that we use daily, and the more I learn about it, the more immersed I become. One of the best feelings for me, is changing what seems to be minute details in the code and watching my creation come to life. It is so satisfying! Another reason would be that programming is an industry that is never going out of style. It is the backbone of tech and could launch me into a bright new career with endless possibilities to do something life changing and expansive. I have always been intrigued by web-design and development, and have a few friends who are application developers or techies, mostly men. Diveristy is yet another great reason, being a woman in the tech industry would be greatly satisfying and empowering for myself and women around me. Since programming is such an important part of the tech world and in turn, the real one; it is important that women not sit back and let this be a male dominated feild. 

I have recenlty exposed myself to programming by using Code Academy, where I have completed 3 different lessons and will continue to teach myself. Other than that I have been creating my own peronal webpage/blog that will be about one of my other passions: cooking. 

  

#### 2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years? 
If accepted into Ada I see myslef going to amazing places on my career path. After completetion of the program and intership I will have the skills neccessary to be a successful web developer, such as a complete understanding of core languages and web concepts and design sense. I imagine that I would either be working for a private company or for the county. I would be working for a company/organization with strong core values, surrounded by a team of like minded indiviguals where we would have stong communication, mutaul respect and completementary skill sets. I would love to get a job developing websites/applications for non-profit organizations, where I could use my knowledge of programming to make a difference in our local communites. 


#### 3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community?  
My contribution to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community is simple: I just have to be myself. Although I am not a minority, I am not gender fluid or trans I feel I am still an asset in this diverse community.  As a woman of 27 years I have experienced more than my fair share of sexism, and all those other terrible isms that people use to judge or "class" one another. I am a person who is all inclusive and open to learning about others' perspectives and yearn for a community that is as well. The opportunity to be learning programming amoung a group of diverse, bright women or women identifiying persons is so exciting and empowering to me.  
   




#### 4.Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently? 
A mistake I made and learned a lot from, here we go: 
When I was a freshman in college I begged my parents to let me take a year off of school to re-charge my batteries and just hang out with my friends. My parents were not having it and they stood strong on the basis that if they were paying for my school, I was to go in the fall. So I went, dragging my feet I started my first semester of college at Daytona State. My biggest mistake was not listening to my parents and just hunkering down and finishing school. I was stubborn and young, and I flitted between majors like photography and early childhood education, trying to find direction. I often skipped class and had to reapeat one of them. My parents were not pleased. 
After that first year of complete misdirection and stubbornness on my part, I realized something. If I would have just put my whole effort into what I was doing at the time I would have been done much sooner and less painfully. I learned that if I would have gone to class, focused and positive I would have had a much better experience that first year. If I could go back and do it differently, I would have spent much more time studying and focused on what major I wanted to choose. I would have put 100% effort into what I was doing and realized that my actions then directly correlated to my future career, life path and financial status.
